Analysis of generation, transformation and  consumption of electricity across European countries


The low-carbon transition, independency from fossil fuels and providing a more stable network of energy supply, will require more focus on sustainable electricity networks. To have a better insight about the current situation and make some prediction about the future trends, this analysis provides an overview of the generation, transformation and  consumption of the electricity across European countries using the open source data sets available in European Union Open Data Portal. In the project management folder the selected data sets for this analysis, a brief data profile and finally the main questions which are going to be answered will be introduced.

The initial data preparation, cleaning, analysis, regression and clustering all have been performed in Python. you can find the whritten codes in Scripts folder. Moreover, initial and modified data sets are collected in Data set folder.
